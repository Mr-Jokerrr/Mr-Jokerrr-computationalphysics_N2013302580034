# The 7<sup>th</sup> homework

- Here is an improved program of the 6<sup>th</sup> homework which considered the geostrophic force, the error during the whole simulation, the wind resistance, and so on

- Here are the [**simulation codes**](code/VPythonMissile.py) and the final [**codes**](code/missile.py)

- After the simulation, the computer wrote the angle as a result in the controller. The results are as below.
