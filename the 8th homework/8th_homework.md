, Show numerically the existence of the resonance, and confirm the dependence of the resonant amplitude on the driving angular frequncy

- 3.8 In the nonlinear pendulum of the equation of motion
, use Euler-Cromer or another suitable method to investigate the relationship between the amplitude and period numerically.Can you give an intuitive argument supporting your results?
